;; ~$ echo do something about the dog | org-capture

;; NOTE The shebang works on macOS since the argument is splited but
;; not on GNU/Linux, one cah use 'emacs --script /path/to/the/script'
;; instead.

;; NOTE I decide to use the shell function `org-capture' from
;; ~/.emacs.d/misc/emacs.sh for now.

;;; Code:

(insert-file-contents "/dev/stdin")

(goto-char (point-min))

(shell-command (format "emacsclient --no-wait \"org-protocol://capture?template=t&body=%s\""
                       (url-hexify-string (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position)
                                                            (line-end-position)))))

(shell-command "emacsclient --eval \"(select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame))\"")

;;; org-capture ends here
