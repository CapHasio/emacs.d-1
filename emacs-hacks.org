* Bind a key to two different commands
  <2017-01-09 Mon>

  When =electric-pair-mode= is enabled, the key =DEL= is interesting:
  when the point is at the end of a empty quote such as "", it runs
  =electric-pair-delete-pair=, otherwise it runs original command such
  as =org-delete-backward-char= in Org mode.

  For example, =RET= calls =emacs-version= when point is at the
  beginning of the line, otherwise it works normally.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar foo-mode-map
    (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
      (define-key map (kbd "RET")
        `(menu-item
          "" emacs-version
          :filter
          ,(lambda (cmd)
             (and (bolp)
                  cmd))))
      map))

  (define-minor-mode foo-mode
    "Foo."
    :lighter " Foo"
    :global t)
  #+END_SRC

  This can be useful since the key can still run *original* command without knowing what it is.
